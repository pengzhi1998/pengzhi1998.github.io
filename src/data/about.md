# Intro

As mentioned, I'm a big fan of Robotics, AI and CS. I'm extremely excited on applying 'intelligence' on robotic applications and dreaming of changing this world with these wonderful technologies.

# Currently

I'm now doing my master's program at Tu Delft. Hopefully I could be prepared for a Ph. D. application next year.

# I'm also big fan of:
